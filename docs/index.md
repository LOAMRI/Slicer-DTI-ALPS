Welcome to the Slicer Diffusion Tensor Image Analysis Along the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS)!

This 3D Slicer extension was designed to assist users in processing Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) for the `DTI-ALPS` index calculation. 


The full documentation of the usage, implementation and updates in the `DTI-ALPS` index is given in this repository and posted online using a [web-based host](). 


## Output examples

The `Slicer DTI-ALPS` extension is a simple way to collect the `DTI-ALPS` index using a GUI interface. The images below represents some examples:

## Modules

### Diffusion Complexity map

This module is able to reconstruct the `Diffusion Complexity`  map from a standard Diffusion-Weighted MRI imaging acquisition.
