# Slicer Diffusion Tensor Image Analysis Along the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS) 

Slicer Module to calculate the diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS). DTI-ALPS is a method proposed by Toshiaki Taoka et al. in 2017 to investigate the perivascular space (PVS) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The PVS is a system of interstitial fluid-filled spaces surrounding blood vessels in the brain, playing a crucial role in waste clearance and neurovascular regulation.
